Requirements:

Each todo created should be categorized as one of:

    Film / Series (To watch)
    Restaurants, cafes, etc. (To eat)
    Books (To read)
    Products (To buy)

In order to determine the category the app will probably need to use various API services such as those offered by Google, Wolfram Alpha, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, Yelp and others.

API services mentioned above are only suggestions. You will have to investigate how to balance the accurate categorization of items with having to deal with multiple API endpoints.

Users should be able to change a category of an item in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.

Users should be able to register, log in, log out and update their profile.
